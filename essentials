1.ROS nodes : Launch ROS core and carry out the following tasks
   a) list the currently running nodes?
        /rosout
   b)What is the purpose of node /rosout
        rosout is a node of roscore and have a prefrential start order.rosout takes the text message from log file and rebroadcast to rosout_agg
   c)List the currently running topics
	/rosout
	/rosout_agg
   d)What topics are subscribed by the node /rosout
	rostopic info /rosout
	Type: rosgraph_msgs/Log

	Publishers: None

	Subscribers: 
	 * /rosout (http://mariyam-john:34223/)
	 e)What topics are published by the node /rosout
	 rostopic info /rosout
	Type: rosgraph_msgs/Log

	Publishers: None

	Subscribers: 
	 * /rosout (http://mariyam-john:34223/)
  f)What are the services provided by the node /rosout
	rosnode info /rosout
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Node [/rosout]
	Publications: 
	 * /rosout_agg [rosgraph_msgs/Log]

	Subscriptions: 
	 * /rosout [unknown type]

	Services: 
	 * /rosout/get_loggers
	 * /rosout/set_logger_level


	contacting node http://mariyam-john:34223/ ...
	Pid: 4016

  g) Kill the node /rosout and again list the running nodes. What is your observation.
	rosnode kill /rosout
	killing /rosout
	killed

	rosnode list
	/rosout

	/rosout is not getting killed.

  h) What are the functions of commands cleanup, info, kill, list, machine &
	ping of the rosnode command-line tool
	rosnode ping	test connectivity to node
		rosnode list	list active nodes
		rosnode info	print information about node
		rosnode machine	list nodes running on a particular machine or list machines
		rosnode kill	kill a running node
		rosnode cleanup	purge registration information of unreachable nodes
	
	
	
2)ROS publisher node : Create a ROS publisher node with the following features.
Node name : '<your frst name_pubnode'
Topic published : 'Greetings'
Message : 'Hello, I am <your first name>'
Message type : std_msgs_String
Rate of publishing message : 10 Hz
Use rospy.loginfo to echo the message published on to the terminal
  a) Run the publisher node and save the terminal screenshot as question2_terminal1.png.
  b) Launch rqt_graph. Save its screenshot as question2_rqt1.png Comment on your
     observations from rqt_graph.
    	the node is being created and communicated through thr topic greetings./rosout gives the output

  c) List the running nodes in the terminal. Save terminal screenshot as question2_terminal2.png

  d) Modify the publisher code to run concurrently three publisher nodes with the name
     '<your first name_node1'. Run rqt_graph and save the screenshot as question2_rqt2.png
    Comment on your observations from rqt_graph.
           the three nodes where created and they communicate through the topic greetings and the message is echoing through rosout

3)ROS subscriber node : Create a ROS subscriber with the name 'RAA24_subnode'
that subscribes to the topic 'Greetings'
  a) Run the publisher (from question 2) and the subscriber and save the terminal screen-
     shots question3_terminal1.png.
  b) Run rqt_graph and save the screenshot as question3_rqt1.png. Comment on your
     observations from rqt_graph

4)ROS publisher-subscriber node Realize the ROS nodes and messages
Run the code for the nodes and answer the questions below.
  a) List the currently running nodes
	mariyam@mariyam-john:~/catkin_ws/src/helon/scripts$ rosnode list
	/CET_2563_1729740741062
	/M1RAA_24_26_2502_1729740734700
	/helon_2450_1729740721758
	/rosout
	mariyam@mariyam-john:~/catkin_ws/src/helon/scripts$ 


  b) List the currently running topics
	mariyam@mariyam-john:~/catkin_ws/src/helon/scripts$ rostopic list
	/hello_class
	/hello_college
	/rosout
	/rosout_agg
	/welcome

  c) What is the role of the node rosout
	rosout is the masternode and log the information from nodes
	Node [/rosout]
	Publications: 
	 * /rosout_agg [rosgraph_msgs/Log]

	Subscriptions: 
	 * /rosout [rosgraph_msgs/Log]

	Services: 
	 * /rosout/get_loggers
	 * /rosout/set_logger_level




 d) Change the name of node 2 to 'M1RAA 2024' and rerun the code. Write down any
	error message displayed.
	mariyam@mariyam-john:~/catkin_ws/src/helon/scripts$ python3  p2.py 
	p2.py:7: UserWarning: 'M1RAA 2024_3713_1729741249530' is not a legal ROS base name. This may cause problems with other ROS tools.
	  rospy.init_node("M1RAA 2024",anonymous=True)
	[FATAL] [1729741249.689600]: unable to register service [/M1RAA 2024_3713_1729741249530/get_loggers] with master: ERROR: parameter [service] contains illegal chars
	[FATAL] [1729741249.693378]: unable to register service [/M1RAA 2024_3713_1729741249530/set_logger_level] with master: ERROR: parameter [service] contains illegal chars

(e) Run the rqt_graph tool and and save the screenshot as question4_rqt1.png
